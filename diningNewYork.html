                    <p>Hummus with a side of Manhattan skyline, anyone? Perched atop the newly-opened Hoxton Hotel in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Laser Wolf is fast becoming one of New York's most popular restaurants. Serving Israeli-style sharing plates and excellent cocktails, the restaurant is an excellent option for those hoping to mingle with hip Brooklynites – and take in stunning views overlooking lower Manhattan.</p>

                    <p>n a quiet street in Manhattan's Flatiron neighbourhood sits one of New York's finest restaurants, Craft. Founded and run by chef Tom Colicchio of Top Chef fame, the restaurant has been serving fresh, farm-to-table dishes family style long before it became trendy. Its space – also designed by Bentel & Bentel, the same New York-based architects behind Le Bernardin, The Modern and Gramercy Tavern – is elegantly understated, perfectly lit by low-hanging Tesla lightbulbs, a Craft signature.</p>

                    <p>Those on the hunt for really, really good Italian food may be overwhelmed with options in New York. However, if you only have one chance to eat Italian, make sure you take it at Frankie's 457 Spuntino. On a brownstone-lined street in Brooklyn's hipster-chic Carroll Gardens neighbourhood, you will feel instantly drawn to the warmly-lit, brick-walled restaurant, smells of fresh sage and frying sausages wafting around you. Great house-made pastas are to be found here (they're famous for their cavatelli with hot sausage and browned sage butter); if you're only peckish, order a sharing board of antipasti or a few crostini for the table. If you've become a Frankie's convert by the end of your meal (and I expect you will), ask for a tin bottle of their in-house Calabrian chili oil, to bring a piece of Frankie's home with you. </p>

                    <p>This is the very definition of a lively neighbourhood New York Italian restaurant and is the perfect spot to end your day after taking in the sights. Suitable for families, couples and solo dining, the warren-like restaurant is always packed so make sure you book ahead. The menu offers a hearty choice of Italian-American classics and an impressive range of home-made pastas. Make sure you order at least one of their infamous paper-thin crust pizzas - so large they have to be hovered above the tables. You will be surprised how easy it is to devour the entire plate, and yes, the vodka pizza with tomato and fresh mozzarella is as delicious as it sounds.</p>
