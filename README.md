# Project 1 Traveler

# Project Requirements
With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-
world problem. You'll also learn about agile development methodologies to 
help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using 
Git branch workflow and pull requests.
You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues 
to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to 
track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits 
of Kanban boards.
You and your group will use everything you’ve learned over the past four 
modules to create a real-world front-end application that you’ll be able to 
showcase to potential employers. The user story and acceptance criteria 
will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the 
following requirements:
1. Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
2. Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
3. Use a CSS framework Bootstrap
4. Include at least one modal instead of native browser alert, confirm, or 
prompt functionality. Look into the CSS framework's documentation 
for more information!
5. Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
6. Be responsive.
7. Have a polished UI.
8. Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file 
structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id 
naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
9. Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies 
used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
